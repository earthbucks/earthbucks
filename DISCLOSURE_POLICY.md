# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Earthbucks takes security very seriously. We greatly appreciate any and all disclosures of bugs and vulnerabilities that are done in a responsible manner. We will engage in responsible disclosures in accordance with this policy and will make our best efforts to fix disclosed vulnerabilities as well as reaching out to ecosystem partners to deploy fixes in a timely manner.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

Refrain from disclosing any security vulnerabilities or issues on public forums, message boards, mailing lists, or other public platforms until you have responsibly disclosed them to Earthbucks and provided sufficient time for the issue to be fixed and deployed. Do not exploit any vulnerability. This includes any potential testnet vulnerabilities, as both mainnet and testnet exploits are effectively public disclosures. Local testing of bugs may be conducted if applicable.

## Reporting a Bug or Vulnerability

When reporting a bug or vulnerability, please provide the following to support@ryanxcharles.com :

* A concise summary of the potential consequences of the issue, if any are known.
* Detailed documentation outlining the steps necessary to reproduce the issue or the process of exploiting it.
* (Optional) Your name will be provided for credit of disclosure. If not provided, you will be treated anonymously, and your privacy will be respected.
* Your email address or any other method of communication.
